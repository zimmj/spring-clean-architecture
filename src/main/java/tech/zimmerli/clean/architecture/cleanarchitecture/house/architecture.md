# Module Architecture

This module follows the principles of clean architecture, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable structure.
Within this module, the architecture is divided into the following layers:

- **Infrastructure Layer**
    - Manages database connections.
- **Representation Layer**
    - Manages API interactions and other UIs.
- **Use Case Layer**
    - Implements the business logic of the module.
- **Domain Layer**
    - Defines the core business entities and rules.

In the Java environment's package structure, each layer is nested within the previous one, reflecting the depth of the clean architecture.
As the code progresses deeper into the layers, it aligns more closely with the principles of clean architecture.

This design promotes modularity and maintainability by ensuring that dependencies flow inward, towards lower-level packages.
A lower package should not rely on its parent package, fostering a clear separation of concerns within the module.

## Connect Modules

Modules should not directly interact with each other through direct calls. 
As described in [Baeldung Spring Modulith](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-modulith), they should communicate with each other using predefined events and handlers. 
This approach allows for easier decoupling and can be adapted to use asynchronous calls.

By adhering to this architecture, we can ensure the creation of modules that are simple to integrate and maintain, following the principles of clean architecture.
